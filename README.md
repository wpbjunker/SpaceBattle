# SpaceBattle
A 2-player PvP spaceship battle game designed, coded, and presented in collaboration with Caelin Bryant and Rachel Nastelin.

## Background
This was the team-based, self-directed final project for Prof. Charlie Curtsinger's course, CSC 213: Operating Systems & Parallel Algorithms, in the Spring semester of 2018. There was no framework for this project other than to implement several of the concepts learned 

I led development on the program to handle user-input and backend calculations ('driver.cu') that would generate graphical information to feed to the display. 

## Credits
This project was created and presented in collaboration with Rachel Nastelin and Caelin Bryant.

This is a copy of original work held under the Grinnell College organization account of Rachel Nastelin. As the original repository is both private and associated with an organization, it cannot be forked and made public using a personal account. I have reposted the repository here with permission, for display as a demonstration of my own work and skill in a portfolio.
