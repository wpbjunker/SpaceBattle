# SpaceBattle
A 2-player PvP spaceship battle game designed, coded, and presented in collaboration with Caelin Bryant and Rachel Nastelin.

## Background
This was the self-directed final project for Prof. Charlie Curtsinger's course, CSC 213: Operating Systems & Parallel Algorithms, in the Spring semester of 2018.

I led development on the program to handle user-input and backend calculations ('driver.c') that would generate graphical information to feed to the display, though other minor contributions (e.g. documentation, testing) can be found throughout this project.
